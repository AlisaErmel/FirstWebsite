            <h2>Essential Black Hole Facts</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="i1"><span>1.CLOSEST</span> The nearest known black hole, called Gaia BH1, is about 1,500 light-years away.</div>
                <div class="i2"><span>2.FARTHEST</span> The most distant black hole detected, at the center of a galaxy called QSO J0313-1806, is around 13 billion light-years away.</div>
                <div class="i3"><span>3.BIGGEST</span> The most massive black hole observed, TON 618, tips the scales at 66 billion times the Sun's mass.</div>  
                <div class="i4"><span>4.SMALLEST</span> The lightest-known black hole is only 3.8 times the Sun's mass. It's paired up with a star.</div>
                <div class="i5"><span>5.SPAGHETTIFICATION</span> A real term that describes what happens when matter gets too close to a black hole. It's squeezed horizontally and stretched vertically, resembling a noodle.</div>
                <div class="i6"><span>6.SPIN</span> All black holes spin. The fastest-known - named GRS 1915+105 - clocks in at over 1,000 rotations per second.</div>
                <div class="i7"><span>7.PARTICLE ACCELERATORS</span> Monster black holes at the centers of galaxies can launch particles to near light speed.</div>
                <div class="i8"><span>8.GRAVITY'S THE SAME</span> If you replaced the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, the solar system would get a lot colder, but the planets would stay in their orbits.</div>
                <div class="i9"><span>9.STAR BOOMS</span> One type of black hole is born when massive stars run out of fuel and explode in supernovae.</div>
                <div class="i10"><span>10.NOT SO RARE</span> Most Milky Way-sized galaxies have monster black holes at their centers. Our is called Sagittarius A* (pronounced ey-star), and it's 4 million times the Sun's mass.</div>

            <h2>Basic Information about Black Holes</h2>
            <p> Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These objects aren't 
                really holes. They're huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black hole is so dense that gravity 
                just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing - not even light - can escape. The event horizon 
                isn't a surface like Earth's or even the Sun's. It's a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black hole.</p>
            <p> There is much we don't know about black holes, like what matter looks like inside their event horizons. However, there is a 
                lot that scientists do know about black holes.</p>
