            <h2>What are meteorites?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="inform">
            <p> A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer 
                space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon.</p>

            <p>When the object enters the atmosphere, various factors like friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the 
            atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate that energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as 
            a shooting star or falling star; astronomers call the brightest examples "bolides." Meteorites vary greatly in size. For 
            geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create a crater.</p>

            <p> Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites are rocks, mainly composed of 
                silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and, stony-iron meteorites that 
                contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups 
                according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy.</p>

            <h2>Types of Meteorites</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="types">
            <h3>Stony Meteorites</h3>
            <p> Stony meteorites are by far the most common. More than 95% of meteorites observed to fall to Earth are stony. They can be 
                divided into chondrites and achondrites. Both types are composed mostly of silicate minerals, but the great majority also 
                contain metallic iron in small-scattered grains.</p>

            <p> Chondrites are named for their most prominent feature - millimeter-sized spherical bodies called chondrules. These chondrules 
                (from the Greek for small sphere) formed 4.5 billion years ago in the Solar Nebula - the cloud of gas and dust from which the 
                Sun, planets, asteroids, and comets formed. Chondrules are not found in terrestrial rocks. These chondrules, along with small 
                mineral grains, accreted to form asteroids during the birth of the Solar System. Chondrites are, by far, the most abundant type 
                of stony meteorite.</p>

            <p> Less common, comprising only a few percent of all meteorites, are achondrites. These are also stony meteorites composed primarily 
                of silicates, but these meteorites have experienced familiar geologic processes of melting and differentiation - although these 
                happened long ago. Most achondrites formed on asteroids during the birth of the Solar System, but a small number formed on Mars 
                and the Moon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="types2">
            <h3>Stony-Iron Meteorites</h3>
            <p> Stony-iron meteorites, contain about equal proportions of metal and silicate material, and are rare (less than 2% of all known 
                meteorites). Stony-iron meteorites form in places where metal and silicate are mixed.</p>
            <p> One type of stony-iron are pallasites - rocks composed of a network of iron-nickel metal surrounding a greenish, silicate mineral 
                called olivine. Pallasites probably form when the olivine-rich mantle of an asteroid mixes with the metallic core. Mesosiderites 
                are mixtures of iron-nickel metal and basalt and probably formed by the collision of two asteroids.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="types3">
            <h3>Iron Meteorites</h3>
            <p> Iron meteorites are really composed of iron and nickel and are extremely dense. They are pieces of the cores of asteroids. Early in 
                Solar System history, asteroids melted and the dense iron-nickel metal sank to the center to form a core - much like the Earth has 
                a core. Iron meteorites are the samples of the cores of ancient worlds.</p>
            <p> While they are rare among meteorites seen to fall to Earth (only a few percent), they are among the most common type of meteorites in our 
                collections, because they can be recognized long after their fall, are very different from Earth rocks, and are resistant to weathering.</p>
            <p> One of the most distinguishing features of meteorites is the presence of the Widmanstatten pattern - the distinctive series of bands in 
                geometric patterns. This pattern is created by the intergrowth of two different iron-nickel minerals formed during very slow cooling (a 
                few degrees every million years) in the core of the asteroid. The presence of nickel is a universal feature of iron meteorites.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="type4">
            <h2>Age & Origination</h2>
            <p> Meteorites range in age. The oldest particles in a meteorite, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions from carbonaceous chondrites, have been 
                dated at 4.56 billion years old. Meteorites that originate from asteroids are all ~4.5 billion years old. Meteorites that originate 
                from the Moon range in age from 4.5 to 2.9 billion years old. Meteorites that originate on Mars range in age from 4.5 billion years old 
                to 200 million years old.</p>
            <p> Most meteorites are believed to originate in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and were formed early in the history of the Solar 
                System ~4.56 billion years ago. These fragments of asteroids were either knocked out of their orbit of the Sun, and into Earth-crossing 
                orbits, through collisions with other objects, or through the interaction of gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and Jupiter.</p>
